/* 
JavaScript cares about the lexical environment when you ask for a variable while running a line of code inside any particular execution context if it canâ€™t find that variable in its memory block it will go at the outer reference or block and look for variables there.


Lexical Environment of an Execution context = Memory Block of that Exec. Cont. + Reference to the to the Lexical Env. of the parent Exec. Cont.


And that outer reference is where the function sits lexically is its outer environment.

So we can say that whenever an execution context is created along with it a lexical environment is created and each lexical environment have reference to its parent lexical environment which points to its memory allocation.
